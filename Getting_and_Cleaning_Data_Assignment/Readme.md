### Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The goal of the project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

### Project Deliverables
The project should have the following deliverables:

1. A tidy dataset
2. An analysis script in R
3. A codebook that describes the dataset and how the analysis was conducted
4. A readme file that describes the above. 

### Project Description
A dataset was provided that contains observations from 30 participants performing a number of activities with a Samsung Galaxy S2 smartphone. The smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope captured measurements from these activities. 


An R script called run_analysis.R was created that does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
3. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
